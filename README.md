## Tools and Technologies

* Unity Game Engine 2020.2.1f1 Editor Version on Windows 10 was used to develop the game in addition to Visual Studio 2019 for coding the script files.
* Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo were used to design Axel, Aravos, Jareth from scratch using their precise vector art tools and extensive editing features
* Adobe Photoshop was used to upscale the frog sprites, extensively modify the wallpapers to be Parallax ready, and enhance the coloring of various sprites used in the game and the cutscenes such as the ground, platforms, etc.
* Adobe Premiere Pro was used to create and edit the cutscenes from scratch with zoom and transition effects to make the cutscenes livelier and more meaningful.
* HandBrake open-source software was used to re-encode the videos to be smaller in size and more compatible with Unity.
* Audacity was used to edit the music, and specifically to analyze Level 2 background music to detect where the specific bass occurs so it can be synced in code with the lightning summon.

## Brief Background
Once upon a time there was a magical land called Zadya. It once had a society called “The Ancients”, they looked like other normal humans except that they were born infused with magic. However, people currently have not seen them in decades, and they believe they went extinct for some unknown reason(s). The land of Zadya is ruled and governed by the “Elder Council” who possessed a few incomplete old scrolls of “The Ancients” that empowered them with an insignificant amount of their magic.

One day, there was a woman named “Aurora” who gave birth to two twins, “Axel” and “Alex”. However, they were born weak and fragile. She desperately searched for a way to save them but there was not. Until one day, a mysterious figure approached her while she was crying desperately and he said: "Do not worry young lady, trust me, they will be fine". He took the twins a few meters away and said something in an incomprehensible mysterious language. When “Aurora”, the twins’ mother, took back her newborns, she found that they became fine and joyful; all traces of weakness and pain had already disappeared. She wanted to thank him and ask him who he was, however, she lost the chance as he immediately vanished, and the secret behind their recovery remained a mystery.

Fifteen years later, “Aurora” got sick, and she can only be healed with magical water located outside the city. Therefore, the twins went on an adventure to save their mother. Meanwhile, the main villain, “Aravos”, have always wanted to become superior to the other members of the “Elder Council” to have full control of Zadya. Hence, he planned to kidnap the twins to exploit their powers to achieve his goals. However, he managed to capture only one and escaped. Therefore, he planned to lure the other twin, “Axel”, into a trap because he will try to follow him and save his brother.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to save the twin and save the magical land Zadya from Aravos’s evil plans.
